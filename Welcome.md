# Welcome to the [Hedgewars](http://www.hedgewars.org) Development Wiki! #

Unlike the main [Hedgewars Wiki](http://www.hedgewars.org/wiki.html), this wiki tries to focus on everything that has to do with building the game from its source-code and modifying/extending the gameâ€™s content and features, e.g. [through Lua](https://code.google.com/p/hedgewars/wiki/LuaAPI).

You can [get the source code](https://code.google.com/p/hedgewars/source/checkout)  or the executable game from the [Hedgewars download page](http://www.hedgewars.org/download.html).
