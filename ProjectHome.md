This is the funniest and most addictive game you'll ever play - hilarious fun that you can enjoy
anywhere, anytime. Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game but the real buzz is from watching the devastation caused by
those pesky hedgehogs with those fantastic weapons - sneaky little blighters with a bad attitude!

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their
hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.

A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, Homing Bee,
Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used,
cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water,
or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island,
or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically
from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn
is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).
