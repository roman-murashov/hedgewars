# Taunts #
This page is a quick overview over all available taunts in Hedgewars. This list is important if you want to create [voicepacks](Voicepacks.md) to ensure that you didn’t forget a taunt.

All files have to be in the Ogg Vorbis format. Make sure the file names you use match the case as used on this page to ensure your voicepacks also work on case-sensitive systems.

Here is an overview of all taunts available in Hedgewars, as of version 0.9.20. There is also a brief description when these taunts are _usually_ (!) played in normal mode, but note that this is only a guideline.  Lastly, there is a transscription of the taunt for the Default voicepack for better orientation.

When playing taunts, there is often a bit of randomness involved, especially if there are multiple taunts for the same events. Additionally, scripts can play these sounds at any occacion. If you are a script author, it is recommended that you try to stick as close to the intended meaning as possible but this is not a requirement, of course.
