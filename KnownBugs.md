# Release 0.9.21 #

## Rubberband shows/places pixels in unexpected locations ##
| Preconditions | The Rubberband is placed/selected in strictly vertical or in rising diagonal (low left end, high right end) orientation. |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details       | In Rubberband's above mentioned orientations (= sprite frames) edge pixels of other orientations are visible/placed.     |
| Workaround    | If you do **NOT** play on official server you could replace your Rubberband's spritesheet (Data/Graphics/amRubber.png) with the [fixed version](https://hedgewars.googlecode.com/hg-history/076aa3b2587dc539033a3eb60305e01e763e1bef/share/hedgewars/Data/Graphics/amRubber.png). If you intend to play over a private server or over local network make sure you only play together with people having the exact same fix or else the game might desync and aborts due to different game/map state information |

# Release 0.9.20 #

## Game crash when roping into "Sea" world edges ##
| Preconditions | "World Edge" in active game scheme are set to "Sea" |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Details       | When a hedgehog, using rope, leaps or swings into the World Edge, it will get teleported to under the water surface. If it then falls into death without using the rope again, the game crashes. |
| Workaround    | Try to avoid getting into the World Edge while using rope. If it happens anyway, just press the fire key immediately to reuse the rope before the hogs falls into death. This should put the game back into a state that will not crash. |
