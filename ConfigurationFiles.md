_TO BE WRITTEN_

## `[Campaign%20<CAMPAIGN_NAME>]` ##
This section stores campaign variables which are stored and read by Lua scripts. Replace “`<CAMPAIGN_NAME>` with the folder name of the campaign. Example: The section for “A Classic Fairytale” would be “`[Campaign%20A_Classic_Fairytale]`”.

Campaign variables are stored on a key-value basis, where the key is the name of the campaign variable and the value is the value of the campaign variable.

Campaign variable names and their values can are chosen by the Lua script authors, but there are some special variables which are used to determine which missions are available in the main menu:

| **Setting** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:------------|:---------|:----------------|
| `Progress`  | Integer  | If present, this number of missions _additional to the first mission_ are unlocked in the menu, starting with the second mission and continuing with the following missions in their regular order (as specified in `campaign.ini`). If the number is `0`, only the first mission is available. |
| `UnlockedMissions` | Integer  | An alternative way to store the unlocked missions in the main menu if the missions aren't unlocked in the regular order. This number specifies how many missions are unlocked. If this variable is set, then the variables `Mission1`, `Mission2`, etc. must be used to specfify the IDs of the unlocked missions. |
| `Mission1`  | Integer  | The `campaign.ini` ID of the first unlocked mission, must be used together with `UnlockedMissions` |
| `Mission2`  | Integer  | ID of the second unlocked mission (continues with `Mission3`, `Mission4`, and so on) |

If neither `Progress` nor `UnlockedMissions` are present, only the first mission is unlocked.

### Examples ###
Simple campaign with 10 missions, missions 1-5 are available:

```
[Campaign%20Simple_Campaign]
Progress=4
```

Complex campaign with 13 missions, missions 2, 7 and 3 are available (in that order):
```
[Campaign%20Complex_Campaign]
UnlockedMissions=3
Mission1=2
Mission2=7
Mission3=3
```

Another campaign with some custom campaign variables:
```
[Campaign%20Another_Campaign]
Progress=2
MyCustomVariable=54
MyCustomString=Hedgewars
```
